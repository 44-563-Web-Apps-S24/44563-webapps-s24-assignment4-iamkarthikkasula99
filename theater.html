        <h1>Karthik Kasula does Chekov tonight</h1>
        <h3>UNCLE VANYA - Anton Chekov</h3>
        <p>

A country house on a terrace. In front of it a garden. In an avenue of
trees, under an old poplar, stands a table set for tea, with a samovar,
etc. Some benches and chairs stand near the table. On one of them is
lying a guitar. A hammock is swung near the table. It is three o'clock
in the afternoon of a cloudy day.  <br>

MARINA, a quiet, grey-haired, little old woman, is sitting at the table
knitting a stocking.<br>

ASTROFF is walking up and down near her.<br>

MARINA. [Pouring some tea into a glass] Take a little tea, my son.
ASTROFF. [Takes the glass from her unwillingly] Somehow, I don't seem to
want any. <br>

MARINA. Then will you have a little vodka instead?<br>

ASTROFF. No, I don't drink vodka every day, and besides, it is too hot
now. [A pause] Tell me, nurse, how long have we known each other? <br>

MARINA. [Thoughtfully] Let me see, how long is it? Lord--help me to
remember. You first came here, into our parts--let me think--when was
it? Sonia's mother was still alive--it was two winters before she died;
that was eleven years ago--[thoughtfully] perhaps more.
